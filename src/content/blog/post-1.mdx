# Hi there!
some text will go in here
## Another smaller heading
This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

even more text in here, just for the sake of it
# Big heading!
It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

1. What
2. If
3. Numbered

`what if I write code like this`
```py index.js
# Program to count the number of each vowels

# string of vowels
vowels = 'aeiou'

ip_str = 'Hello, have you tried our tutorial section yet?'

# make it suitable for caseless comparisions
ip_str = ip_str.casefold()

# make a dictionary with each vowel a key and value 0
count = {}.fromkeys(vowels,0)

# count the vowels
for char in ip_str:
   if char in count:
       count[char] += 1

print(count)
```
