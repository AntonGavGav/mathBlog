# Hi there!
some text will go in here
## Another smaller heading
This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`
some more text in here
even more text in here, just for the sake of it
# Big heading!
It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
    - WHAT
    - what
- [links](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_link)
- and more!

1. What
2. If
    1. Penis
    2. What
3. Numbered
4. LIst

Numbered list or some like that

One liner code looks like this, should I fix it?
`console.log("something")`

$$
A_{m,n} =
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

`what if I write code like this`
```py index.js
# Program to count the number of each vowels

# string of vowels
vowels = 'aeiou'

ip_str = 'Hello, have you tried our tutorial section yet?'

# make it suitable for caseless comparisions
ip_str = ip_str.casefold()

# make a dictionary with each vowel a key and value 0
count = {}.fromkeys(vowels,0)

# count the vowels
for char in ip_str:
   if char in count:
       count[char] += 1

print(count)
print("And what if the code is too long to fit in the box I gave it, what happens than, tha'ts the question I should be asking myself?")



ADDD SOME PADDING TO THE CODE
```
